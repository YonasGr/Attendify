# Backend Audit and Implementation Summary

## Executive Summary

The Attendify backend API has been **completely reimplemented** from stub endpoints to a fully functional, production-ready REST API. All major issues identified in the audit have been resolved, and comprehensive documentation has been added.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Course Addition Failing (400/500 Errors) ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Backend was returning stub responses without actual database operations or validation.

**Solution:**
- Implemented complete database operations for course CRUD
- Added comprehensive input validation (required fields, data types, ranges)
- Added instructor existence and role validation
- Implemented duplicate course code checking (returns 409 Conflict)
- Added proper error messages for each validation failure
- Added year range validation (2000-2100)

**Validation Now Includes:**
- Required fields: code, name, instructorId, semester, year
- Instructor must exist and have instructor role
- Course code must be unique
- Year must be valid number in acceptable range
- Instructors can only create courses for themselves

### 2. Missing Course Lists for Instructors ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** GET /api/courses endpoint returned empty arrays - stub implementation.

**Solution:**
- Implemented complete database queries with JOIN operations
- Added role-based filtering:
  - Admins see all courses
  - Instructors see only their courses
  - Students see only enrolled courses
- Added query parameter support (filter by instructorId)
- Included instructor details (firstName, lastName, username) in responses
- Proper ordering by year, semester, and code

### 3. Non-functional Admin/Instructor Panels ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** All protected endpoints were stubs without authentication or authorization.

**Solution:**
- Implemented JWT authentication middleware
- Created role-based authorization middleware
- Added authentication to all protected endpoints
- Implemented proper permission checks:
  - Admin-only endpoints (user management, system-wide access)
  - Instructor endpoints (course/session management for owned resources)
  - Student endpoints (own data access)
- All CRUD operations now work with real database queries

### 4. Backend Connectivity and Syncing Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** No error handling, inconsistent responses, stub implementations.

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive error handling throughout
- Implemented proper HTTP status codes:
  - 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request
  - 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found
  - 409 Conflict, 500 Internal Server Error
- Created consistent error response format
- Added detailed error logging
- Implemented input sanitization middleware
- Added database connection error handling

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
Complete PostgreSQL schema with:
- 5 main tables (users, courses, sessions, enrollments, attendance_records)
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Unique constraints where needed
- ON DELETE CASCADE for data integrity
- Role validation constraints
- Timestamp tracking (createdAt, updatedAt)

### Authentication System
Full JWT + bcrypt implementation:
- User registration with duplicate checking
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt, 10 rounds)
- Login with password verification
- JWT token generation (7-day expiration)
- Token refresh mechanism
- Secure token storage and transmission

### Authorization
Comprehensive role-based access control:
- Authentication middleware (JWT verification)
- Authorization middleware (role checking)
- Granular permissions per endpoint
- Self-access vs admin access separation
- Resource ownership validation

### API Endpoints Implemented
All endpoints fully implemented with database operations:

**Authentication (3 endpoints)**
- POST /api/auth/login
- POST /api/auth/register
- POST /api/auth/refresh

**Users (5 endpoints)**
- GET /api/users (with role filtering)
- GET /api/users/:id
- POST /api/users
- PUT /api/users/:id
- DELETE /api/users/:id

**Courses (5 endpoints)**
- GET /api/courses (with role filtering)
- GET /api/courses/:id
- POST /api/courses
- PUT /api/courses/:id
- DELETE /api/courses/:id

**Sessions (5 endpoints)**
- GET /api/sessions (with role filtering)
- GET /api/sessions/:id
- POST /api/sessions
- PUT /api/sessions/:id
- DELETE /api/sessions/:id

**Enrollments (3 endpoints)**
- GET /api/enrollments
- POST /api/enrollments
- DELETE /api/enrollments/:id

**Attendance (5 endpoints)**
- GET /api/attendance
- GET /api/attendance/session/:sessionId
- GET /api/attendance/student/:studentId
- POST /api/attendance
- DELETE /api/attendance/:id

**Total: 26 fully functional endpoints**

### Validation & Security
Robust input validation and security:
- Required fields validation
- UUID format validation
- Email format validation
- Role value validation
- Input sanitization (XSS prevention)

- CORS configuration

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling:
- Try-catch blocks on all async operations
- Proper HTTP status codes
