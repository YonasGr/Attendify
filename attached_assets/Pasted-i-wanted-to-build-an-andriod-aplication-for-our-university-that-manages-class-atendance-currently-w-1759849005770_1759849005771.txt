i wanted to build an andriod aplication for our university that manages class atendance, currently we are using on paper signing and it is boring, i wanted to change it to modern and figitalized way based on this project idea,

Project Idea: Attendify - Smart University Attendance System1. Project VisionTo replace the traditional, manual paper-based attendance system with an efficient, secure, and user-friendly digital platform. This system will streamline the attendance process for instructors, provide students with easy access to their records, and give administrators powerful tools for data analysis.2. Core ConceptThe system will be centered around a time-sensitive, session-specific QR code.An instructor starts a class session through their web dashboard, which generates a unique QR code.The instructor projects this QR code on the screen in the lecture hall.Students use a mobile-friendly web app on their phones to scan the QR code.The system instantly verifies the student, the class, and the time, marking the student as "Present."This method is fast, reduces the chance of students signing in for their friends (buddy punching), and provides instant, accurate data.3. Key Features by User Rolea. Student Portal (Mobile-First Web App)Secure Login: Students log in using their university credentials.Dashboard: A simple view of their upcoming classes for the day.QR Code Scanner: A primary button to open the camera and scan the attendance code.Attendance History: Students can view their attendance record for each course, including percentages (e.g., "85% attendance in CS101").Profile: View their basic information (Name, Student ID, Enrolled Courses).b. Instructor Portal (Web Dashboard)Secure Login: Instructors log in with their university credentials.Dashboard: View their scheduled classes for the day.Course Management: View a list of their assigned courses and the students enrolled in each.Start Session & Generate QR: A simple button to begin an attendance session for a specific class. This generates the unique QR code to be displayed.Real-time Attendance View: As students scan the code, the instructor's dashboard updates in real-time, showing who has checked in.Manual Override: Ability to manually mark a student as present, absent, or late if they have technical issues (e.g., phone died).Attendance Reports: View and export attendance data for their courses (e.g., download a CSV for the semester).c. Administrator Portal (Web Dashboard)Secure Login: For university administrative staff.User Management: Add/edit/remove student and instructor accounts.Course & Enrollment Management: Create courses, assign instructors, and manage student enrollments.University-Wide Analytics: View high-level attendance statistics across different departments, courses, or specific time periods.System Settings: Configure system-wide parameters (e.g., how long a QR code is valid after being generated).4. Proposed Technology StackFrontend: React (or Vue.js) - For building a modern, responsive, and interactive user interface for all three portals.Backend: Node.js with Express.js - To build a robust REST API that handles business logic, user authentication, and database interactions.Database: Firebase Firestore (or MongoDB) - A NoSQL database that is excellent for real-time applications, allowing the instructor's dashboard to update instantly as students check in.Authentication: Firebase Authentication (or JWT) - To securely manage user logins and protect different parts of the application based on roles (student, instructor, admin).QR Code Generation: A simple library on the backend (like qrcode) to generate the QR codes.Deployment: Vercel/Netlify for the frontend and Firebase Functions/Heroku/AWS for the backend.5. Potential Enhancements (Phase 2)Geolocation Fencing: As an added layer of security, the system could verify that the student is within the geographic boundaries of the classroom when they scan the code.Automated Notifications: Send push notifications or emails to students whose attendance drops below a certain threshold.LMS Integration: Integrate with existing Learning Management Systems at your university (like Moodle or Canvas) to sync course and enrollment data automatically.Advanced Analytics: Create detailed dashboards with charts and graphs to visualize attendance trends.
